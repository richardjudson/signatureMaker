Title: Build Signature Files for the httrpathway package
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ricahrd Judson
Maintainer: Richard Judson <judson.richard@epa.gov>
Description: Formats the input signature files into 3 main outputs
    catalog
    list of gene lists
    list of pipe-delimited gene lists.
    The main functions are signatureBuilder.v2() and signatureBuilderRandom().
    The first function reads in files for each ofthe sources and combines them
    to build the signarure RData files with gene lists, and the catalog. The second
    builds the random signatures and adds these to the catalog. Each signature
    source has its own function to put data into teh proper format. To add a new
    source, copy one of these and format your new data in the proper way. The
    function signatureDBupdate() saves the current signature files into the
    folder saved_versions. This is jsut a safety measure.
